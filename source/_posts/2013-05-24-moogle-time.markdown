I've coded a new Pebble watchface that I am calling "Moogle Time". 
The moogle sprite has three states: awake, tired, and asleep, and these change depending on the time of day.
The HP represents the hour and the MP represents the minutes. You can download the code on ([github](https://github.com/savagejen/MoogleTime)) and the pbw from ([myPebbleFaces](http://www.mypebblefaces.com/view?fID=3545&aName=savagejen&pageTitle=Moogle+Time&auID=3553)).
